# Memory-game
Memory game where a pattern of X and O are shown on the screen.  
The user tries to memorize the board, then another person chooses one to switch 
and the user tries to figure out which one it was.
There is actually an alternating parity pattern to represent each row and column, 
allowing the astute observer to know exactly which one was selected, as it changes 
the parity for exactly one row and column.
